# Welcome to PGx Toolkit

**PGx Toolkit** is a Python package designed for personalized pharmacogenomic network analysis. It bridges the gap between raw genotype data and pharmacogenomic knowledge bases to uncover actionable insights through network science.

## Key Features

*   **Genotype Parsing**: Efficiently reads 23andMe raw data formats.
*   **Annotation Mapping**: Links variants to PharmGKB drug annotations.
*   **Network Construction**: Builds a graph where nodes are Genes and Drugs, and edges represent pharmacogenomic interactions.
*   **Centrality Analysis**: Identifies key drivers in your personal pharmacogenomic landscape.

## Getting Started

To install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

See the [API Reference](api/genotype.md) for detailed usage.
